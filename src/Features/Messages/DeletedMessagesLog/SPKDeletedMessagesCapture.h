// Persistent candidate + reconciliation pipeline for the deleted-messages log.
//
// KeepDeletedMessages.x already owns the single chokepoint hook on
// `IGDirectCacheUpdatesApplicator._applyThreadUpdates:completion:userAccess:`
// and is the only place we can guarantee ordering relative to the
// remove-keys neutering. Rather than fight install order, that hook calls
// these two C functions directly:
//
//   • `spkDMCaptureNoteInsert(...)` on every insert/replace, so we persist a
//     normalized snapshot of the body BEFORE any unsend can happen.
//   • `spkDMCaptureNoteRemoveSids(sids, ownerPk, threadId)` on every reason==0
//     remove, so we know which captured snapshots became deleted records.
//
// All persistence + media downloading happens here, gated by
// `msgs_deleted_log` (read fresh — never cached).
